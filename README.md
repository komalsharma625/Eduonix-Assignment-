Hi there! I'm Komal, currently learning at Eduonix. 
In this COVID-19 project, I analyzed data to understand how the virus affected people around the world. I looked at things like how many people got sick, how many got better, and how many sadly passed away. This helped me learn about the pandemic and how to use data to help.

In this Global Super store project, I dug into the Sample Superstore dataset to understand how well the store is doing. I looked at sales and profit in different ways: comparing them over time, across different parts of the country, and among different types of customers. I used some fancy techniques like comparing numbers, making maps, and sorting data into groups. Making sure the data was accurate was really important too. This project helped me learn a lot about analyzing data and making sense of it. It was like solving a big puzzle! I'm excited to keep learning and using these skills in the future.


In ott dashboard project, we aim to create a comprehensive dashboard comparing the performance of three popular streaming platforms: Netflix, Hotstar, and Prime Video. By gathering and analyzing data on subscriber metrics, content popularity, revenue, geographical and competitive analysis, we seek to provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each platform. This dashboard will serve as a powerful tool for decision-makers in the streaming industry, enabling them to track performance, identify trends, and make informed strategic decisions. Throughout this project, we will prioritize data accuracy, visualization clarity, and user accessibility to ensure the dashboard effectively meets the needs of its audience.

### Using Dental Metrics to Predict Gender

This project aims to analyze dental data to predict an individual's gender based on specific dental features, integrating dentistry, data science, and machine learning. Previous research has highlighted sexually dimorphic traits in dental characteristics, such as tooth size and shape.

The project begins with collecting a comprehensive dataset of dental records, including measurements of teeth dimensions and morphology, alongside the gender of individuals as the target variable. Data preprocessing is essential, involving cleaning to handle missing values, feature engineering to enhance predictive power, and normalization to standardize feature scales.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to uncover patterns and relationships between dental features and gender, utilizing visualizations and statistical tests to identify significant differences.

The core task is developing a machine learning model using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost Classifier. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with cross-validation employed for generalizability.

Model performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices to assess gender distinction capabilities. The project's goal is to establish a robust methodology for gender prediction, contributing to forensic science and archaeology, while future work may expand the dataset and refine the model for improved accuracy.
